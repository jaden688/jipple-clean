Canonical mothership fat-agent agents live in this folder.

Current intent:
- `SparkByte`
- `The Gremlin`
- `Slappy`
- aliases that intentionally point at those same payloads, like `Supervisor`

Rules:
- These are still normal MPF agent payloads and stay in the registry.
- They are classified as `fat_agent` in `JL_Agents.mpf.json`.
- Runtime support agents, generated agents, and specialist/operator agents should not be mixed into this folder.
